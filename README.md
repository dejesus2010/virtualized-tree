# virtualized-tree

## Introduction

**virtualized-tree** Is my implementation of [react-virtualized-tree](https://bvaughn.github.io/react-virtualized/#/components/List) 

I forked it for my use case and my use case only. You should use the original: [here](https://diogofcunha.github.io/react-virtualized-tree/#/examples/basic-tree).
